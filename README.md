# Devlogs Maker
This is an app that I made to create devlogs easily and post them to my static website hosted on GitHub. It's a GitHub app that uses the device flow. It interfaces with the GitHub REST API to commit text files and images to a specific branch specified in settings.

It'll be updated as I go, when I need another feature.

### Requirements

- Godot 4.4.1
- GitHub permissions for user tokens, and repository access
- Config file **(needs to be updated)**

For the config file, you would need to manually enter the repo info and app info.
Also need to add the user name and email under user info.
And the url for the base repo under urls.
