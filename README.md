# Devlogs Maker
This is an app that I made to create devlogs and post them to my website hosted on Github. 
It interfaces with the Github API to GET repo contents, PUT files up on the repo, and DELETE files. 
It can POST requests to Github to renew user tokens.

It's a Github app that uses the device flow.

I will update it as I go.

### Requirements
- Godot 4.3
- Github permissions (user tokens)
- Config file

For the config file, would need to manually enter the repo info and app info.
Also need to add the user name and email under user info.
And the url for the base repo under urls.

### Assets
- Courier Prime Regular Font
- My plane sprite image
- My airmail border
