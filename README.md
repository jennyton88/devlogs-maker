## Devlogs Maker
This is an app that I made to create devlogs and post them to my website hosted on Github. 
It interfaces with the Github API to GET repo contents, PUT files up on the repo, and DELETE files. 
It can POST requests to Github for expired user tokens.

It's a Github app that uses the device flow.

I will update it as I go.

### Requirements
- Godot 4.3
- Config file
